# Colored Candy
![Colored Candy Preview](Attachments/colored-candy-combined-preview-2.png)
This is a cute lil' theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that changes the interface colors based off of your chosen accent color.

You can choose your accent color in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) under **Settings → Appearance → Accent color**.

This theme will change the background colors according to your accent color's hue, and create two *new* psuedo accent colors offset from the original hue, and calculating the saturation and lightness for the psuedo accent colors based off of the original.

If you see anything that looks broken and needs fixing, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/colored-candy/issues) so that I know to fix it.
