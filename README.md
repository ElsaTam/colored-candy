# Colored Candy
![Colored Candy Preview](Attachments/colored-candy-combined-preview-2.png)
This is a cute lil' theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that changes the interface colors based off of your chosen accent color.

This theme requires no initial setup besides installation and choosing your accent color.

If you see anything that looks broken and needs fixing, please create an [issue](https://github.com/Erallie/colored-candy/issues) so that I know to fix it.
